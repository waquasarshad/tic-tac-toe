Here is a **complete, detailed prompt** you can copy and use to generate your advanced React Tic Tac Toe project exactly the way you want.

---

## 🚀 FULL PROJECT GENERATION PROMPT

Create a fully frontend **advanced 3D Tic Tac Toe game** using **React**. The project must be visually impressive and demonstrate advanced animation, interaction design, and 3D effects. No backend required.

The goal is to showcase:

* Advanced CSS transforms
* 3D perspective
* Physics-based motion
* Three.js integration (if needed)
* Interaction design thinking
* Visual creativity
* Production-level polish

---

## 🧱 Core Requirements

### 1️⃣ Tech Stack

* React (Vite or Create React App)
* Three.js (for 3D effects)
* CSS3 (advanced transforms & perspective)
* SVG animations
* No backend
* Must be deployable on GitHub Pages

---

## 🎮 Game Logic

* Standard 3x3 Tic Tac Toe
* Alternating turns (X and O)
* Win detection
* Draw detection
* Restart button
* Clean state management using React hooks

Optional bonus:

* Add 3D 4x4x4 cube Tic Tac Toe mode

---

## 🎨 Board Effects & Interactions

### 🖱 Hover Effects

* Each cell rotates slightly on hover
* Smooth 3D tilt effect

### 🔄 Move Played

* Cell flips in 3D when clicked
* X or O appears with SVG stroke drawing animation

### 🌀 Drag Interaction

* User can drag mouse to rotate entire board freely
* Like a 3D product viewer
* Add smooth inertia (momentum continues briefly after release)
* Use requestAnimationFrame for smoothness

### 🌌 Parallax

* Subtle parallax movement based on mouse position
* Background shifts slightly
* Adds depth

### 💡 Dynamic Lighting

* Light source changes based on board rotation
* Simulate shadow depth
* Slight gradient shift

---

## 🏆 Win Animation

When someone wins:

* Winning cells lift upward in 3D
* Losing cells drop slightly
* Entire board tilts dramatically
* Add 3D confetti effect
* Add subtle camera shake effect
  (Small shake but noticeable quality boost)

---

## ✨ Advanced Animation

* Animate X and O using SVG stroke-dashoffset drawing
* Smooth easing functions (cubic-bezier)
* No abrupt animations
* Use physics-inspired motion curves

---

## 🎥 Visual Polish

* Glassmorphism UI panel
* Soft shadows
* Depth layers
* Clean typography
* Dark modern theme

---
